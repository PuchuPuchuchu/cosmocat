## Features 
### Home Page
After sign up/log in, user will enter the home page. User can see the summary of the current week's focus time (from Monday to Sunday) on the chart displayed. They can click on the sidebar for animal collection, shop and friendboard, or just start focusing. 
### Animal Collection
A list of animals that user has attained will be shown in Animal Collection. Upon clicking on each animal icon, user will see that animal's customized story. 
### Shop 
50 stars -> 1 match to get new animal. 
### Friend Board
User can see their friends' focus time for this day/week. They can also add friends by sending or accepting friend requests. 
### Time setter & Countdown 
The main functionality of the app. User can set a duration of time to focus on their tasks and tag them. 

## Development Plan  
(To be completed as much as possible in MS3) 
### Statistic page 
with more detailed and visual representation of the user's focus time such as heat map, pie chart etc.
### Todo List
Replace current bar chart on homepage to Todo List, so that users can view and edit their ToDo list when they first enter the app. 
### Predefined timer 
(eg. tomato clock mode)
### Town 
Harvest stars with friends, unlock individual/group achievements to gain more motivation.
### Constellation cat
Surprise! What animal the user gets might be dependent on the date itself.
### Settings 
Move log out button to settings. User may set their preferences(e.g. keep screen on) in settings.
### Animal foster page 
Under collection page. Animals may have lifecycles. 

### Others 
User guide when they first use the app.
Show story background after user signs up.
Sound effect.

## Testing of app 
### Authentication
- email : needs to be proper email format eg. xxx@xxx.com
- password: at least 6 characters 
- tag: can only select one at a time
- For testing purposes, home page statistics is shown as seconds and user gets 1 star per second. After MS3, this reward system will be changed as designed and stats will be shown in minutes.
